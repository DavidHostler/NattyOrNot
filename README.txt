This is a project I'm doing entirely for fun and humour in my downtime. 
It will combine mobile app development using React-Native with Python REST services for the viewing and uploading of image files.
Using tensorflow for image classification, the serverside ML program will return a humorous response as to whether a user's physique is "Natty" or "Not" 
and will determine this response using a pretrained binary-classifier neural network trained on other physiques.
This is a play on the classic fitness community meme, and likely won't be that funny to a non-lifter, although I'm hoping that everyone can appreciate the concept!

Either way, I think it's really cool to use technology to drug-test a lifter at a glance using AI. 

DISCLAIMER:

An AI program trained on a few thousand images of bodybuilders is never going to be fully accurate, as the training data labels may often be 
incorrect. This is not actually a surefire or safe way to verify whether somebody is on PED's. In fact, the idea actually came from another joke- that one time Tinder claimed on April 1st to be introducing a "height verification feature"- hence the timing of this announcement, it was in fact a joke at the expense of men who lie about their height on dating apps in order to get dates. It is in that same spirit I am making this app at the expense of so-called fake-naturals- the AI's predictions are to be taken humorously and not as a serious indictment of someone's claim to naturality.


Thanks for reading through this description. Once the app is fully completed, this README file will also contain detailed instructions for deploying the app, possibly within a docker container so that anybody can try it out. I'm obviously a nerd, so I only use Linux, and so this project is designed to run on a Linux machine (Ubuntu 20.04 to be precise). A docker image should make the app enjoyable for the mortals who still use Windows and MacOS :) 


Happy Lifting!
